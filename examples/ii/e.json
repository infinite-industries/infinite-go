  "description": "<p>An exhibition of works expressed through the media of instruments by luthier Ben Mason, and artist J. Daniel Graham. Ranging from traditional techniques to experimental materials, and processes,&nbsp;these instruments explore the connections to present and future history.</p><p>Anyone that ventures into the world of instrument making almost always find themselves collaborating with the past. No matter the approach one recognizes that they are part of a connective tissue, a continuing thread that reaches backward, while simultaneously moving forward. This exhibition is documenting a crossover in that connective thread of past and future history.</p><p>Luthier Ben Mason, and Artist J. Daniel Graham approach their instrument making practice from divergent perspectives while sharing similar goals at the base of their craft. Mason pursues a deep technical understanding of material and its performative qualities, while fine tuning a personal craft identity linked to the great tradition of luthiers. Graham champions an exploratory curiosity, pushing the context of traditional materials while still staying connected to the craft, all the while driving the purpose and concept of the instrument into the aesthetics of a functional Art object.</p>",

  "description": "<p>A special night of music planned with Kentucky's own Dark Moon Hollow!</p><p>Doors at 6:00pm and show starting at 7:00pm with support TBD!</p><p>From their bio:</p><p>Since the winter of 2017, Dark Moon Hollow has seen numerous members come and go, from notable projects all over the Bluegrass State. Originally forming from improv jams in kitchens, livingrooms, etc. late into the Lexington nights, a core was formed and brought to stages in various forms over the next 5 years. In what could be described as a constant evolution of artists, Dark Moon Hollow has had many song writers, with original member \"Trigger\" Trey being the one constant on both studio albums.</p><p>With the help of JD Thomas (Building Rockets, Charlie Woods and Deep Hollow), Ishi Wooton (Restless Leg String Band, Bloodroots Barter), Riley Logan (Forrest), and Thomas Keathley (Dillon Carmichael, Moonshine District), the band's current lineup brings together a mixture of honky tonk, traditional bluegrass, and both psychadelic and southern rock. The eclectic group can only be described as high energy, no matter the tempo. Noted for powerful harmonies, their goal is to make the best music that speaks not only to themselves but one another and their fanbase as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.darkmoonhollow.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.darkmoonhollow.com</a></p><p>Due to the extremely limited nature of this event, all sales are final, no refunds or exchanges.</p><p><br></p>",

The normally idyllic gathering, where the motto is \"no men, no meat, all manners,\" is upended when the Society's matriarchs must confront the startling revelation that an atom bomb may be falling on their fair city. As fears are confronted, and confessions fly, the chipper ladies stay firm in their commitment that the quiche is a mighty thing and that one must \"respect the egg.\"</p>",

  "description": "<p>Oscar Wilde said, \"Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future,\" acknowledging that we are all works in progress, and most of us struggle with both good and at least somewhat malicious impulses over the course of our lives.&nbsp;<em>Sinners and Saints</em>&nbsp;examines both the labels and the blurred lines as artists present mixed messages in their approach to these twinned themes. Drawn from the permanent collection, this exhibition includes traditional Christian imagery as well as depictions of fallen men and women. The art ranges from the sixteenth through twentieth century and includes an exquisite Guido Reni drawing of the&nbsp;<em>Madonna and Child</em>,&nbsp;along with William Hogarth's depictions of riotous behavior on&nbsp;<em>Gin Lane</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Beer Street</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Historically, saintliness and sin were most often pinned to the female body, whether women bore the representation of spiritual purity or enticed men to indulge in carnal pleasure. Visually speaking, however, what the image says can be more ambiguous than the parable it allegedly portrays, calling into question the artist's intentions. In a print based on Edward Burne-Jones's painting&nbsp;<em>The Annunciation</em>,&nbsp;the hovering angel Gabriel is the only clue to the important announcement being delivered; Mary appears as a winsome young woman in clinging draperies. By contrast,&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;Adulterous Woman</em>&nbsp;of the New Testament story is not shown in shame, but as triumphant in redemption, girded in a metal breastplate. It is easy to understand why no one cast the first stone; she looks capable of leading a crusade.</p>",

  "description": "<p>In the early 1950s, Ralph Eugene Meatyard and Van Deren Coke set out to photograph all the people, homes, and businesses on Georgetown Street in Lexington. Together they made 150 images and exhibited thirty of them in the Lexington Camera Club's annual show in November 1956. The results are sometimes joyful, sometimes disturbing.</p><p>\"These are the people, the places, no derision shown,\" Meatyard wrote in an exhibition statement. \"There is no squalor, but rather the moments when these people are at peace with themselves. It is not distorted to show the depths, as were the W.P.A. Farm Security Photographs. It is personal with a sense of appreciation for the peaceful in the world. We have only one story to tell and it is that these people are like you and me.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Before the Newtown Pike extension, Georgetown Street ran from what is now New Circle Road to Short Street downtown and was a primarily African American neighborhood. Just as Georgetown Street has transformed over the years, so has our thinking about documentary photography and the impulse to use the camera to expose social injustice, often without the consent of its subjects. This exhibition examines the context in which two white photographers chose a lower income neighborhood occupied by people of color for a project intended to celebrate its residents.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to the Ralph Eugene Meatyard Estate, whose gift of twenty photographs is at the center of this exhibition.</p><p>Exhibition sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.visitlex.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VisitLex</a>.</p>",

This was not a surprise given the dispositions of the current justices, but it is another challenge among the issues of equality and respect, and gender and racial discrimination facing women today.</p><p>In solidarity with them, this exhibition features works from the Museum's permanent collection showing women of various ages, backgrounds, and orientations. Their faces and bodies reveal attitudes of confidence, anxiety, poise, and resignation. Paintings and prints of young girls by Hattie Hutchcraft Hill, Fletcher Martin, Alice Neel, and Andy Warhol are seen alongside mature women, including rural and urban subjects photographed by Doris Ulmann and Garry Winogrand. One surprising inclusion is Julien Dupré's beloved canvas, <em>In the Pasture (The Milk Maid)</em>,&nbsp;affectionately called \"the cow painting\" by many visitors. For our purposes, we draw your attention to the struggle of the female farmhand, whose efforts to control the movement of the large dairy cow in her care can be seen as a metaphor of persistence against overwhelming odds.</p><p>Along with the art on view, we have solicited opinions, information, and interpretive texts from a range of campus colleagues and community members to create an installation for contemplation and commiseration.</p>",

How high on the wall are paintings hung? How are artworks cared for when not on view? Who decides which pieces to show or acquire?
