    "description": "<p>For almost two decades, The Kentucky Theatre has screened classic films every Wednesday (matinee and evening) from late May until early September. Over the years, this summer series has proved to be a perennial favorite. From film noir standards like <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> to classic Disney animation like <em>Pinocchio</em> and more recent classics like <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, the <a href=\"https://www.kentuckytheatre.org/summer-classics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SUMMER CLASSICS</a> offer something for every film fan. Come see movies from your youth, introduce your kids and grandkids to the stars of Hollywood's Golden Age, or discover a new personal favorite.</p><p>This week: The story of boxer Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) as he rises through the ranks to earn his first shot at the middleweight crown. His violence and temper led him to the top in the ring but destroyed his life outside of it. A masterpiece by Martin Scorsese.</p>",
